# Seizure Detection With Machine Learning

Problem: It can be difficult to ascertain whether someone has had an epileptic seizure a misdiagnosis at this stage can have very severe effects where the epilepsy, lying untreated, has grave consequences. Sometimes specialists attach EEGs to patients to and use the readings of brain activity from the EEG to ascertain whether someone is having a Epileptic Seizure. I want to see the effect of applying a machine learning algorighm onto the data and examine its efficacy.

With the background out of the way, we can look at what our data looks like:

Unfortunately, our features are anonymized, so there may not be a great deal we can learn from exploring those features. We can still normalize and standardize these features and see how they perform when we run them with our machine learning models.
