# Seizure_Detection_With_Machine_Learning


Problem: It can be difficult to ascertain whether someone has had an epileptic seizure a misdiagnosis at this stage can have very severe effects where the epilepsy, lying untreated, has grave consequences. Sometimes specialists attach EEGs to patients to and use the readings of brain activity from the EEG to ascertain whether someone is having a Epileptic Seizure. I want to see the effect of applying a machine learning algorighm onto the data and examine its efficacy.
